## **Data Import and SQL Setup**  
### **Steps to Import Data into the SQL Database**  
1. **Prepare the CSV File**  
   - Clean and organize raw data into structured CSV files.  
2. **Create Tables in SQL**  
   - Design appropriate tables in the SQL database to store data.  
3. **Import CSV Files into SQL**  
   - Use SQL tools or scripts to upload the CSV files into the database.
